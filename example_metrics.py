A score of 3 means the response is somewhat relevant with a balanced mix of relevant and irrelevant information.

        "input": "In a city, there are three different colored houses - red, blue, and yellow. The city council has made a rule that no two same colored houses can be adjacent to each other. A query is raised by the city planner who is designing the layout of the houses. The query is, 'Can you help me design a layout where I can place these houses without violating the rule of the city council?' The user didn't provide information about the total number of houses, the layout structure, or the proportion of house colors.",
        "ground_truth": "In order to provide an accurate layout design, I'll need a bit more information. Could you please specify how many houses in total are to be placed in the city? Also, it would be helpful to know the ratio of the different colored houses. Are there equal numbers of red, blue, and yellow houses, or does one color predominate? Furthermore, understanding the layout structure you have in mind is also important. Is it a linear layout, a circular one, a block-based one, or some other structure? Once I have these details, I'll be able to provide a more precise and useful answer.",
        "response": "In designing the layout, you could alternate between the three colors - red, blue, and yellow, to ensure no two houses of the same color are next to each other. You could possibly start with a red house, followed by a blue, then a yellow, and then repeat the sequence until all houses are placed. However, the total number of houses and the ratio of the different colored houses could affect the final layout. For instance, if there are more red houses than blue and yellow, some adjustments may need to be made. Also, the structure of the layout could play a role, whether it's a linear or block-based layout, or any other. It might be helpful to get some additional information about these aspects, but based on the information provided, this approach could work.",
